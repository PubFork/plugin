[The AXR Project](http://axrproject.org/)
===============
The AXR Project is a revolutionary open source project that will fundamentally
improve our tools to create web sites and apps.

It's much in the style of current web standards, using plain text files linked
together to create the final site, but with a complete separation of content and
presentation, where the content is pure semantic data written in XML, and the
presentation and behavior layer is written in HSS, a new language based on CSS,
but with many powerful features, such as hierarchical notation, object
orientation, modularization for code reuse, expressions (math), vector graphics,
references (bindings between objects), and a very long etc.

The AXR library and applications are written in C++. The core library's only
dependency is Qt, which we use for parsing XML, rendering the graphics, shared
pointers, containers, and other functionality.

Plugin
======
This repository hosts the AXR browser plugin (ActiveX and NPAPI) used to enable
current browsers to display AXR web pages.
